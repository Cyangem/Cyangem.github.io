      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction-from-intern-to-data-engineer&#34;&gt;1. Introduction: From Intern to Data Engineer&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My journey as a Data Engineer began with curiosity — how do banks turn millions of data points into insights that drive lending or risk strategy? Over time, I found myself designing ETL pipelines, automating workflows, and even building machine learning pipelines to predict loan delinquency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before becoming a full-time Data Engineer, I started as a DE intern for 3 months. That experience helped me understand the fundamentals of data pipelines, governance, and business reporting. Later, I joined a bank where I spent 1.5 years as a Data Engineer, supporting business intelligence, automation, and analytics for multiple departments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
